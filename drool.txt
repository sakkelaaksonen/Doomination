Misc. Author Info       : 

Description             : Sneaky exploration and slaughter puzzles in tech base.
                        : Made this map to git gud with Arch-Viles and to learn 
                        : advanced mapping techniques and vertical layout and combat structuring as well as 
                        : Slade stuff such as custom midi file and end screens.
                        :
                        : Aesthetically, I like my maps to play and look like Doom. I hope to have captured 
                        : the look and feel of OG mid-levels with a splash of my own budding style.
                        : Combat may be brutal at times but there is always cheese if you look around.
                        : Saving before keys is a good idea if you are a casual player.
                        :
                        : Difficulty: Pro casual / (so really hard at at times but still mostly easier than modern megawads). 
                        : Somewhere between TNT and Plutonia. Lots of RNG involved so cheesing is not always the same.
                        
                        : One large map, 15-30 mins.
                        : Vanilla Doom gameplay. No jumping/crouch, no vertical look 
                        : ( But do what you want. that jump might save your life. )
                        : Hardware rendering recommended due to texture choises.
