Description             : Combat puzzles in tech base.
                        : Made this map to git gud with Arch-Viles and learn more
                        : advanced mapping techniques and vertical layout and combat building. 
                        : Aesthetically, I like my maps to play and look like Doom. I hope to have captured 
                        : the look and feel of OG mid-levels.
                        : Combat may be brutal but there is always cheese if you look around.
                        : Saving before keys is a good idea if you are a casual player.
                        :
                        : Difficulty: Pro casual / (so really hard at at times but still mostly easier than modern megawads)

                        : One large map, 15-30 mins of gameplay  
                        :
                        : Vanilla Doom gameplay. No jumping/crouch, no vertical look.
                        : Hardware rendering recommended due to texture choises.
